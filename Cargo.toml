# TODO ideally we would directly use this patched version from `integritee-cli`
# but it is quite a mess to make it work both from repo `integritee-worker` and here
sgx_crypto_helper = { version = "1.1.6", path = "./shared/incubator-teaclave-sgx-sdk/sgx_crypto_helper/" }

# Needed because cargo can't handle when features are unavailable on the latest commit in a branch.
# Remove when https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/issues/1388 is resolved.
